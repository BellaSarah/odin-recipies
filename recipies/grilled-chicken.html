        <h1>Grilled Chicken</h1>
        <p>Want something simple for the night that tastes amazing but isn't detrimental to your health? 
            Are you an 80 year old man with Kidney issues?</p>
        <p>Then this is the right spot! Let's get cooking!</p>
        <h2>Set up</h2>
 
        <p>First things first, you'll want to set out everything you need for the recipe. 
            <ul>
                <li>Boneless, skinless, orgainic chicken breast</li>
                <li>Non-stick pan</li>
                <li>avocado oil</li>
                <li>Bragg organic sprinkle</li>
                <li>Sink full of <strong>HOT</strong> soapy water to help with clean up</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Now that we've gotten everything set out we can get started. Be careful not to burn yourself on the pan.
        </p>
        <h2>Cooking Time!</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Get out a cutting board, and a knife, and cut up your chicken breast how you like. </li>
                <li>Get the avocado oil and put it on your non-stick pan and let it heat up the oil just enough.</li>
                <li>Coat the chicken in the Bragg orgainic sprinkle seasoning. A generous amount should be used. 
                    Don't let any chicken breast be seen through the seasoning. <strong>Don't worry, it's salt-free, your kidneys are ok.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Be careful</strong> on this next part. It's a little trickey. Place the coated chicken into the 
                frying pan. <strong>Oil may splash just a bit, so be careful.</strong></li>
                <li>Cook chicken for 1 minute on high on one side until you can see it turning white.</li>
                <li>Flip the chicken over, and cover. Lower the heat to med-low checking every 5 minutes with a thermometer
                 until internal tempurature reaches 165 degrees F.</li>
                 <li>Once fully cooked, take chicken off the pan and place on a plate.</li>
                 <li>To fully enjoy, use utensils like a british person, smiling all along as if you're correct about someting but won't say it
                     because you're too polite.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>Best served along side friends while teasting eachother. Get some Kombutcha, some asparagus, and some pasta, and you've got a great meal!</p>
        <p><strong>Enjoy!!!</strong></p>
